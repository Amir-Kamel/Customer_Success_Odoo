## 📌 New Enhancements  

### 1️⃣ CRM → Customer Success Integration  

🔹 When a **CRM Lead** moves to the **Won** stage, automatically create a **new Customer Success record**.  

🔹 Ensure the **Related CRM field** in Customer Success is automatically linked to the corresponding Lead.  

⚡ Once this field is set, other dependent fields (**Title, Partner, Phone, Email**) will auto-populate automatically (using the existing logic already handled).

### 2️⃣ Dashboard  

A new dedicated **Dashboard menu** will be created.  

#### 🖼️ Layout  
Dashboard divided into **two vertical sections**.  

#### 🔼 Upper Section (Analytics Cards)  
Displays **three horizontal cards**:  
- 📊 **Average Health (Global)** → Shows the overall average health score across all pipeline records.  
- 🏆 **Top 5 Customers (Highest Health)** → Shows top 5 customers with the highest average health (across their records).  
- ⚠️ **Bottom 5 Customers (Lowest Health)** → Same as above but for the lowest averages.  

💡 Cards displayed with **animated health bars or circular progress indicators**.  

#### 🔽 Lower Section (Customer Cards)  
Cards similar to the **Contacts module** in Odoo, each showing:  
- 👤 Customer Avatar  
- 🏷️ Name / Partner ID  
- 📞 Phone  
- 📧 Email  
- 📊 Average Health (across all pipeline records)  

✅ **Rules**:  
- If a Partner already exists, don’t duplicate → update their average health.  
- New records for the same Partner automatically update their health average.  

#### 🔗 Interactions  
- Clicking a Customer Card should ideally:  
  - 🔎 Redirect back to the **Customer Success Pipeline**, pre-filtered to show only that Partner’s records.  
  - Alternative: open a **dedicated filtered view** with a return button.

### 3️⃣ Technical Notes 🛠️  

🔹 Create a new model to store **Dashboard Customer Data**:  
- 🏷️ Name  
- 📞 Phone  
- 📧 Email  
- 📊 Average Health Score  
- 🔗 Relation (Many2many) with Customer Success records  

🔹 Use a **hash map (dictionary)** for averages:  
- **Key** = Partner ID  
- **Value** = Average Health score across their records
