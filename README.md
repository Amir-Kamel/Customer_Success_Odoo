### üïí DH Portal Time Off Website App (Assigned to **Amir**)  

###### ‚úÖ Done  
1. **Portal Access Error Message**  
   - Fixed the error message appearing on the website when portal users try to access waiting-for-approval pages without internal rights.  
   - Example of the error:  
     ```
     Uh-oh! Looks like you have stumbled upon some top-secret records.
     Sorry, andrew (id=8) doesn't have 'read' access to: - User (res.users)
     ```
   > **Note:** Need to discuss the **portal access limitation issue** ‚Äî since portal users can‚Äôt have rules or groups, this approach might not be functional.

### üìà CRM Module (Assigned to **Mahmoud**)  

###### ‚úÖ Urgent  
1. **Return to Won Stage Notification**  
   - When a CRM record returns again to the **Won stage**, if the related record in CSM still exists (not deleted):  
     - Automatically add an **activity notification** in the related CSM record.  
     - The activity should notify that the CRM record has **returned to the Won stage**.  
   - This is similar to the previous task but reverses the logic (previously triggered when leaving the Won stage).
